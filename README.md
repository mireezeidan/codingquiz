This is the link to my webpage and repo.

## Purpose
The purpose of this webpage is to generate a quiz that contains a timer, goes through multiple questions, and saves the users initials and score.

## My Experience
My experience creating this webpage was a bit challenging due to it being a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It taught me how to better research and find features I wanted to include as well as debug issues that may arise.
